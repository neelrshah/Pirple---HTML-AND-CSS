  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Kalam was born in 1931, the son of a little-educated boat owner in Ramaeswaram, Tamil Nadu. His father was also the imam of 
    the small mosque in Rameswaram. He had an unparalleled career as a defence scientist, culminating the highest civilian award 
    of India, Bharat Ratna. As a chief of the country's defence research and development programmer,Kalam demonstrated a great 
    potential for dynamics and innovations that existed in seemingly moribund research establishment.This is the story of Kalam's 
    own rise from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles, as well as the story of AGNI, TRISHUL and NAG missiles 
    that have become household names in India and that have raised the nation to the level of a missile power of international 
    reckoning.Since independence, India has sought in various ways, to self-realization, and to adulation and success.</p>
